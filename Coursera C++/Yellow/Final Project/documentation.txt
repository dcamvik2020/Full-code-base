/// Final Task Number 1
/// Task: to make a data base that interacts with
/// user through stdin-stdout.

/// DataBase : pairs (date, event)
/// date     : year-month-day (integers)
/// event    : not empty string without ' ';'\n';etc.

/// POSSIBLE : 1 date ---> several DIFFERENT events
/// same events --> don't save

/// COMMANDS:
/// Add Date Event
/// Del Date Event
/// Del Date         -- ALL events for ONE date
/// Find Дата        -- ALL events for ONE date
/// Print            -- ALL events for ALL dates

/// GARANTED:
/// 1 cmd - 1 line (ignore empty strings)
/// ALL cmds are correct (look earlier)
/// ALL dates, events are not empty strings
/// ALL dates with negative years or ... will be deleted
///              so, they won't be printed
/// days in month : all consist of 31 days
/// year -- it can be negative, 0, positive

/// INPUT ERRORS:
/// unknown cmd --> print "Unknown command: cmd"
/// letters before or after date -- error
/// date format: "Wrong date format: DATE"
///              DATE -- was written by user
///              DATE: parts != "", but can be zero or even negative
/// if format is correct --> check month
///              month in [1, 12], else "Month value is invalid: MONTH"
/// if month is correct --> check day
///              day in [1, 31], else "Day value is invalid: DAY"

/// errors are in day && month --< only 1 message about error in month
///       1-1-1    correct
///      -1-1-1    correct
///      1--1-1    correct fromat, but incorrect   month=-1
///     1---1-1    incorrect fromat: month with "--" before number
///     1<200b>-+1-+1    correct date

/// error --> print message --> exit(0) (STOP)
